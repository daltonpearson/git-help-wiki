### How to Submit a Merge Request
- Add the Done label to the issue that this merge request fixes.
- Add a reference to the issue this merge request fixes in the comments or in your commit messages (preferably in your commit messages but if you already pushed in the comments is fine). 
- If you add it in your commit message this will allow for auto closing of the issue when it is merged. 
- To add a reference to the issue in your merge request or commit message simply type #issueNumber. Ex. Fixes #135
- The word Fixes must prepend the #issueNumber so it will auto close the issue after a merge.
